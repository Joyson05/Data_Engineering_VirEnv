Step 1:
#First download .deb jdbc connection from link (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) for ubuntu linux 22.04

Step2:
#place the downloaded .deb file in home directory in ubuntu

Step3:
#Install the .deb Package using command:
sudo dpkg -i /home/dev2/mysql-connector.deb(where the .deb file is placed)

step4:
create a directory called mysql-connector inside airflow directory
& come out of that directory(cd ..)

Step4:
#Extract the Contents
dpkg-deb -x /home/dev2/mysql-connector.deb(where the .deb file is placed) /mysql-connector(path to place the extracted file)

Step5: (#optional -- just try this step if 6th step dosen't work)
#Use the JDBC Driver JAR
pyspark --driver-class-path /tmp/mysql-connector/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-8.4.0.jar


Step6:
Go to the path where mysql-connector file is extracted(/tmp/mysql-connector/usr/share/java/) & it will be extracted as .jar files like (mysql-connector-java-8.4.0.jar & with one more file)
Copy the path of the file(mysql-connector-java-8.4.0.jar) and go to spark code and place it like shown below: 
       
spark = SparkSession.builder \
            .appName("ReadLogsToDataFrame") \
            .config("spark.jars", "/tmp/mysql-connector/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-8.4.0.jar") \
            .getOrCreate()


verify EC2_Pyspark_connect.py file to know how to give the above details.
